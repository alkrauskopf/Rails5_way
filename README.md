What is this project?  Why is it?

My primary rails accomplishment relates to the building and monetization of tools supporting continuous improvement
practices for schools/teachers/students. Concurrent with that ever-evolving program, I taught myself Rails from clean slate
while also learning about what educational are and what they could be. The platform of tools began as Rails 2.3,  adding
additional complexities (and upgrade to 3.2) to my learning experience. While the 3.2 platform represents a significant
achievement, the code itself preserves much of indicators of where I came from,rather than where I am today, as a developer.

THIS PROJECT is a gathering of capabilites that I've worked on and mastered in a manner consistent with "The Rails Way"
principles.  It more accurately reflect my current abilities and understandings.

The application serves no useful business purpose.
This project has just begun.  It will continue to broaden in scope, creating a more comprehensive picture of my capabilities.
