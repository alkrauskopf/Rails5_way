What is this project?  Why is it?

My primary rails accomplishment relates to the building/monetizing tools for schools/teachers/students.
As part of that multi-year effort, my goal was to learn Rails. It began as a Rails 2.3 toolkit, which added an upgrade
to my learning experience. The platform grew significantly over the years, with many success stories.
But mus of the code preserves much of where I came from,rather than where I am today, as a developer.

THIS PROJECT is a gathering of capabilites that I've worked on and mastered in a manner consistent with "The Rails Way"
principles.  It more accurately reflects my current abilities and understandings.

The application serves no useful business purpose.
This project has just begun. It will continue to broaden in scope, creating a more comprehensive picture of my capabilities.
