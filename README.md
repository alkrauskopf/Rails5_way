What is this project?  Why is it?

My primary rails accomplishment relates to the building/monetizing of tools for schools/teachers/students.
As part of that multi-year effort, my goal was to learn Rails. It began as a Rails 2.3 toolkit, which added an upgrade
to my learning experience. The platform grew significantly over the years, with many success stories.
But much of the code preserves where I came from,rather than where I am today, as a developer.  Not pretty.

THIS PROJECT is a gathering of Rails capabilites that I've worked on and mastered having come to appreciate "The Rails Way."
It more accurately reflects my current abilities and understandings.

The application serves no useful business purpose. And the project has just begun.
It will continue to broaden in scope. As it does, a more comprehensive picture of my capabilities will emerge.
